# ChekcM8_Chess_Puzzle_Rating_Machine
Training the huge Lichess data set, this machine will infer how difficult a chess puzzle is to capture the king in!  Fed with a FEN set board, the machine produces a  classification of Easy, Medium, or Hard to complete.  Statistical learning will be implemented in the predicting of qualified Glicko-2 rating ranges.  www.kaggle.com/datasets/lichess/chess-puzzles  www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf
